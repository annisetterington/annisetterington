My name is Annika (they/them) and above you can see a photo of me sitting outside while wearing my headphones :smile:. I'm in my 5th year of **Neuroscience**, but I'm also minoring in **English** and doing a **Science Communication and Leadership Certificate**!

### Why did I enroll in this course?
I enrolled in this course because coding is an important part of being a researcher, and I would love to be able to run models and accurately represent my findings if I can, rather than getting someone else to do it. And I would ideally like to be able to explore data past basic statistical tests. 

### What got me interested in Neuroscience?
I was extremely undecided on what I wanted to study in university in grade 12 because I was having a hard time choosing if I wanted to pursue an arts or a science degree. But, when we learned about the anatomy of the brain and how synapses worked in grade 12 biology, I thought that was *really* cool so I decided to major in Neuroscience!

### What are my career plans?
My career plans are less *one specific path that I plan to follow* and instead are more *let's just keep going and see how it goes*. With that in mind, the next step for me would be to get a Master's degree in Neuroscience and pursue a career as a researcher (most likely working in a lab). However, I also have an interest in science communication and community work, so I would like to incorporate that into my career as well if possible, because what is science if we can't communicate our findings! And far in the future, I may pursue a second Master's degree in Information to become a research librarian, but we'll see how I feel about my *first* Master's degree before I attempt a second one.
